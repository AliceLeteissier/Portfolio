Personal Portfolio - Alice Leteissier



WHAT I LEARNED

- how to use Flex-box for simple layouts
- Making responsive layouts that take into account screen sizes
- Make different elements responsive by using clamp()
- Make complex media queries that work both for video and images

PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED

- Making the site responsive for phones: I managed to make the general layout change according to screen size, but need to improve on adapting the size of each elements (especially images and video) according to screen size)
- My design works well on a computer because it relies a lot on hoover, but would need a different functionality on a phone.
- Not being able to follow the design I had planned because of my limited coding skills 

HOW I SOLVED PROBLEMS

- Watching tutorials taking me step by step to build very simple things, and trying to implement them in my code, and in my design thinking
- using AI
- Letting myself be surprise by the mistakes/accidents in my code, and allowing myself to incorporate them in my design
